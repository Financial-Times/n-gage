# STYLE NOTES
# -----------
#
# Two main types of tasks.  Common and sub.
#
# Common tasks are the public facing API of the Makefile.  Developers/CI should run these commands.
# Sub-tasks are the inner, private workings of n-makefile.  Developers/CI ought not to run these commands.
#
# Type specific conventions
#
# - For ‘common’ tasks
#     - name must match the directory name they generate
#     - if we permit the task to be overwritten it may end with % instead of its final letter, allowing it
#       to be overwritten without producing warnings. (this is a hack, of course, and means we have to be
#       careful about how we name our common tasks!)
#     - by convention, app/component Makefiles make call commontaskname-super from inside their override
#       to run the parent common task functionality.
# - For sub-tasks
#     - snake_case_is_used
#     - should always start with a `_`
#     - the name should match the pattern _commontaskname_subtaskname.  E.g. _install_scss_lint
#
# All task conventions
#
# Try to end each command with a friendly `@echo $(DONE)`
#
# For npm dev dependencies, assume they're there (hope that the devDependencies bring them), optionally
# warn the developer to install them.  Don't try to install them from here.
#
# Scss-lint is a special case because Ruby.  That is allowed to be installed here but let's try to avoid
# doing that unless we absolutely have to.
